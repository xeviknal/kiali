== Introduction

Kiali provides answers to the questions: _What microservices are part of my Istio service mesh and how are they connected?_

== Table of contents

=== Description

A Microservice Architecture breaks up the monolith into many smaller pieces that are composed together. Patterns to secure the communication between services like fault tolerance (via timeout, retry, circuit breaking, etc.) have come up as well as distributed tracing to be able to see where calls are going.

A service mesh can now provide these services on a platform level and frees the application writers from those tasks. Routing decisions are done at the mesh level.

Kiali works with Istio to visualise the service mesh topology, features like circuit breakers or request rates.

Kiali also includes an integration with Jaeger Tracing to provide distributed tracing out of the box.

=== Getting Started

This README is targeted mainly toward Kiali developers. If you are not a developer but want to learn more about Kiali, you will find the link:https://www.kiali.io[Kiali documentation] more helpful. For some instructions on running Kiali without having to git clone this repository or build anything, please see the link:https://www.kiali.io/documentation/getting-started[Getting Started] page.

==== Testing on a OpenShift 4.x Cluster

To install a OpenShift 4.x cluster in AWS, use this link:https://github.com/kiali/kiali/blob/master/hack/aws-openshift.sh[hack script].

Run the hack script with `--help` for usage details. Here is a brief synopsis:

* `aws-openshift.sh -kuca true create` : Create an AWS cluster that includes Service Mesh, Kiali, Jaeger, ElasticSearch
* `aws-openshift.sh status` : Provides details about your AWS cluster
* `aws-openshift.sh oc-env` : Provides details about how to set up the `oc` client in your shell so it can access your AWS cluster
* `aws-openshift.sh destroy` : Destroy the AWS cluster
* `aws-openshift.sh bi-install` : Install BookInfo demo in the AWS cluster
* `aws-openshift.sh sm-uninstall` : Uninstall the Service Mesh and all its components that were previously installed via `create` or `sm-install`
* `aws-openshift.sh sm-install` : Re-install the Service Mesh and all its components
* `aws-openshift.sh k-uninstall` : Uninstall the Kiali component that was installed via `create` or `sm-install`

Here's a way you can work with AWS to do Kiali development:

* `aws-openshift.sh -kuca true create` to create your cluster with Service Mesh. `-kuca true` tells the script to create a cluster admin user "kiali" with password "kiali". This takes roughly 30 minutes to complete.
* `aws-openshift.sh status` to show you details about your cluster, including "oc login" details as well as the console URL among other things
* If you want to build and deploy your own Kiali:
** First must uninstall the one that was installed when you created the cluster. To do this, run `aws-openshift.sh k-uninstall`
** Next build Kiali and the Kiali operator normally (see below for details on that)
** Push the dev builds of your Kiali and Kiali operator into the AWS cluster's image registry via `make cluster-push`.
** Create the new Kiali Operator in your AWS cluster via `make operator-create`
** Create the new Kiali in your AWS cluster via `make kiali-create`
** At this point, your dev build of Kiali should be starting up. Wait for it to come up and then you can access the Kiali UI normally.

=== Container Image

The container images for Kiali and the Kiali Operator are published on https://quay.io/organization/kiali[Quay.io in the kiali organization].

=== License and Copyright

See the link:./LICENSE[LICENSE file].

== Building

[NOTE]
These build instructions assume you have the following installed on your system: (1) link:http://golang.org/doc/install[Go Programming Language], (2) link:http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git[git], (3) link:https://docs.docker.com/installation/[Docker] or link:https://podman.io[Podman], and (4) make. If you are using `podman` instead of `docker`, pass the environment variable `DORP=podman` when executing `make`. To run Kiali in a cluster after you build it, it is assumed you have a running OpenShift or Minikube environment available to you.

[NOTE]
Currently, Kiali releases are built using Go 1.14. Although Kiali may build correctly using other versions of Go, it's suggested to use version 1.14 for development to ensure replicatable builds. Makefiles will require this minimum version of Go.

To build Kiali:

* Clone this repository inside a GOPATH. These instructions will use the example GOPATH of "/source/kiali/kiali" but you can use whatever you want. Just change the first line of the below instructions to use your GOPATH.

[source,shell]
----
export GOPATH=/source/kiali/kiali
mkdir -p $GOPATH
cd $GOPATH
mkdir -p src/github.com/kiali
cd src/github.com/kiali
git clone git@github.com:kiali/kiali
git clone git@github.com:kiali/kiali-operator kiali/operator
export PATH=${PATH}:${GOPATH}/bin
----

* Build Kiali

[source,shell]
----
cd ${GOPATH}/src/github.com/kiali/kiali
make build
----

* At this point you can run the Kiali tests

[source,shell]
----
cd ${GOPATH}/src/github.com/kiali/kiali
make test
----

== Running

[NOTE]
If you want to quickly get up and running to play with Kiali and do not wish to git clone the repository or build anything, see https://www.kiali.io/gettingstarted for instructions.

[NOTE]
Before deploying and running Kiali, you must first install and deploy link:https://istio.io[Istio]. There are a few places that you can reference in order to learn how to do this. We recommend using link:https://maistra.io/docs/installation/[Maistra] which is a variant of Istio. If you choose to use Istio, make sure to follow the link:https://istio.io/docs/setup/platform-setup/openshift/[OpenShift preparation steps]. Also, check the link:https://kiali.io/documentation/getting-started/#_kiali_version_requirements[version requirements] on our website to read notes about Istio and Maistra compatibility. There is a link:https://github.com/kiali/kiali/tree/master/hack/istio/install-istio-via-istioctl.sh[install-istio-via-istioctl.sh hack script] that can install Istio for you.

=== Running on OpenShift or Kubernetes/Minikube

By default, the make targets used to push and deploy Kiali images will assume you have an OpenShift 4.x cluster installed and running and that `oc` is found in your $PATH.

If you wish to push and deploy Kiali to an installed and running Kubernetes (via Minikube) environment, pass the environment variable `CLUSTER_TYPE=minikube` to the `make` commands and make sure `kubectl` is found in your $PATH.

If you have neither minikube nor a remote OpenShift cluster, you can pass the environment variable `CLUSTER_TYPE=local` to the `make` commands and make sure you have either `oc` or `kubectl` in your $PATH. This requires your Kubernetes cluster to be able to pull from your local image repository.

In order to deploy on Minikube using the below instructions, and to be able to access the deployed services, you must ensure you have the Registry and Ingress addons. To do this, ensure you run `minikube addons enable registry` and `minikube addons enable ingress` and add `kiali` as a hostname in your `/etc/hosts` via something like this command: `echo "$(minikube ip) kiali" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts`

If you are using `docker`, make sure the endpoint for your OpenShift image registry or Kubernetes image registry is configured as an insecure registry in your docker daemon config.

=== Building the Container Image

Create the Kiali container images through the "container-build" make target:

[source,shell]
----
cd ${GOPATH}/src/github.com/kiali/kiali
make container-build
----

This will build the Kiali image.

Generated container image will be consistant with the host machine (either x86_64 or aarch64).

=== Pushing Kiali operator and Kiali images to your cluster

[source,shell]
----
cd ${GOPATH}/src/github.com/kiali/kiali
make cluster-push
----

This actually invokes the `container-build` target as well, so you technically do not have to run `make container-build` as a separate step.

=== Deploying Kiali operator to your cluster

[source,shell]
----
cd ${GOPATH}/src/github.com/kiali/kiali
make operator-create
----

Deploying the Kiali operator needs to be done only one time. After the operator is deployed, you can deploy and remove Kiali any number of times using the steps described below.

=== Deploying Kiali to your cluster

[source,shell]
----
cd ${GOPATH}/src/github.com/kiali/kiali
make kiali-create
----

This creates a Kiali custom resource (CR) which instructs the Kiali operator to install Kiali. A secret will be created if needed (i.e. when the authentication strategy is set to `login`).

=== Removing Kiali from your cluster

If you want to remove Kiali, you can do so via the operator by executing the `kiali-delete` target. This target will also remove the secret.

[source,shell]
----
cd ${GOPATH}/src/github.com/kiali/kiali
make kiali-delete
----

If you want to purge your cluster of all Kiali resources without going through the operator to do it, you can run the `kiali-purge` target instead. This does not use the operator, instead it purges all Kiali resources using the oc/kubectl command.

[source,shell]
----
cd ${GOPATH}/src/github.com/kiali/kiali
make kiali-purge
----

=== Reloading Kiali image

[NOTE]
To easily facilitate development, this allows you to do `make clean build cluster-push-kiali kiali-reload-image` to quickly get your new Kiali build into your running cluster.

If you already have Kiali installed but you want to recreate the pod with a new container image, you can run the following command:

[source,shell]
----
cd ${GOPATH}/src/github.com/kiali/kiali
make kiali-reload-image
----

=== Removing Kiali operator from your cluster

[source,shell]
----
cd ${GOPATH}/src/github.com/kiali/kiali
make operator-delete
----

[NOTE]
After this completes, the `kiali-create` and `kiali-delete` targets will be ineffective until you run the `operator-create` target to re-deploy the Kiali operator again.

=== Running Standalone

Rarely, you may want to run Kiali outside of any cluster environment, perhaps for debugging purposes. To do this, run:

[source,shell]
----
cd ${GOPATH}/src/github.com/kiali/kiali
make install
make run
----

The "install" target installs the Kiali executable in your GOPATH /bin directory so you can run it outside of the Makefile:

[source,shell]
----
cd ${GOPATH}/src/github.com/kiali/kiali
make install
${GOPATH}/bin/kiali -config <your-config-file>
----

== Configuration

Many configuration settings can optionally be set within the Kiali Operator custom resource (CR) file. See link:https://github.com/kiali/kiali-operator/blob/master/deploy/kiali/kiali_cr.yaml[this example Kiali CR file] that has all the configuration settings documented.

== Embedding Kiali

If you want to embed Kiali in other applications, Kiali offers a simple feature called _Kiosk mode_. In this mode, Kiali won't show the main header, nor the main navigation bar.

To enable Kiosk mode, you only need to add a `kiosk=true` URL parameter. You will need to use the full path of the page you want to embed. For example, assuming that you access Kiali through HTTPS:

* To embed the _Overview_ page, use `https://_kiali_path_/overview?kiosk=true`.
* To embed the _Graph_ page, use `https://_kiali_path_/graph/namespaces?kiosk=true`.
* To embed the _Applications list_ page, use `https://_kiali_path_/applications?kiosk=true`.

If the page you want to embed uses other URL arguments, you can specify any of them to preset options. For example, if you want to embed the graph of the _bookinfo_ namespace, use the following URL: `http://_kiali_path_/graph/namespaces?namespaces=bookinfo&kiosk=true`.


== Configure External Services

=== Jaeger

If you have Jaeger installed in a custom way that is not easily auto-detectable by Kiali, you need to change in the Kiali CR the value of the jaeger > url

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: kiali.io/v1alpha1
kind: Kiali
metadata:
  name: kiali
spec:
...
    external_services:
      jaeger:
        url: http://jaeger-query-istio-system.127.0.0.1.nip.io
...
----

=== Grafana

If you have Grafana installed in a custom way that is not easily auto-detectable by Kiali, you need to change in the Kiali CR the value of the grafana > url

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: kiali.io/v1alpha1
kind: Kiali
metadata:
  name: kiali
spec:
...
    external_services:
      grafana:
        url: http://grafana-istio-system.127.0.0.1.nip.io
...
----

== Services API Documentation

Kiali can display API Documentation of your services. See https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1235410/61569413-0e870480-aa3c-11e9-9527-bbea18eff475.png[API documentation screen capture] and https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1235410/61569419-1777d600-aa3c-11e9-82cc-f9510e5b9808.png[API type list screen capture].

=== Configure your services

Your services must be annotated with the type of API ('rest', 'grpc', 'graphql') and a URL to the spec of the API. 
If the API spec is served from the service itself, Kiali will infer the hostname and port :

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: myservice
  annotations:
    kiali.io/api-type: rest
    kiali.io/api-spec: /v1/api-spec  
spec:
...
----

The API spec can also be served from any http/s URL, internal or external to the cluster :

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: petstore
  annotations:
    kiali.io/api-type: rest
    kiali.io/api-spec: https://petstore.swagger.io/v2/swagger.json  
spec:
...
----

For now, only REST APIs have their spec displayed but we are working to support gRpc and GraphQL soon.
A live console to test your APIs directly with Kiali is also being worked on.

=== Customize API docs annotations

You can configure Kiali to use your own annotation names with the Kiali CR

[source,yaml]
----
...
apidocs:
  annotations:
    api_spec_annotation_name: "my-annotation-for-api-spec"
    api_type_annotation_name: "my-annotation-for-api-type"
...
----

== Additional Notes

=== Customize the UI web context root

By default Kiali UI is deployed to the top level of `https://kiali-istio-system.<your_cluster_domain_or_ip>/`.  In some situations such as when you want to serve Kiali UI along with other apps under the same host name, e.g., `example.com/kiali`, `example.com/app1`, you can edit Kiali Config Map and provide a different value for `web_root`.  Note: the path must begin with a `/` and not end with `/` (e.g. `/kiali`).

An example of custom web root:

[source,yaml]
----
...
server:
  web_root: /kiali
...
----

=== Running the UI Outside the Core

When developing the http://github.com/kiali/kiali-ui[Kiali UI] you will find it useful to run it outside of the core to make it easier to update the UI code and see the changes without having to recompile. The prefered approach for this is to use a proxy on the UI to mount the core. The process is described https://github.com/kiali/kiali-ui#developing[here].

To connect with the backend and avoid the javascript prompt requesting authentication you need to send the requests with a specific header.
[source]
----
X-Auth-Type-Kiali-UI: 1
----
The response will contain the header
[source]
----
WWW-Authenticate: xBasic realm="Kiali"
----
Otherwise the header will be
[source]
----
WWW-Authenticate: Basic realm="Kiali"
----

=== Running A Locally Built UI Inside the Core

If you are developing the UI on your local machine but you want to see it deployed and running inside of the core server, you can do so by setting the environment variable CONSOLE_VERSION to the value "local" when building the container image via the `container-build` or `cluster-build` target. By default, your UI's build/ directory is assumed to be in a directory called `kiali-ui` that is a peer directory of the GOPATH root directory for the core server. If it is not, you can set the environment variable CONSOLE_LOCAL_DIR to the value of the path of the root directory for the UI such that `$CONSOLE_LOCAL_DIR/build` contains the generated build files for the UI.

For example, if your GOPATH directory for the Kiali project is `/source/kiali/kiali` and you have git cloned the Kiali UI repository in `/source/kiali/kiali-ui` then you do not need to set CONSOLE_LOCAL_DIR. You can embed your locally built console into the core container image via:

[source,shell]
----
CONSOLE_VERSION=local make container-build
----

If you git cloned the Kiali UI repository in directory `/my/git/repo` and have built the UI there (such that the build files are located at `/my/git/repo/build`) then you can embed that locally built console into the core container image via:

[source,shell]
----
CONSOLE_VERSION=local CONSOLE_LOCAL_DIR=/my/git/repo make container-build
----

=== Disabling SSL

In the provided OpenShift templates, SSL is turned on by default. If you want to turn it off, you should:

* Remove the "tls: termination: reencrypt" option from the Kiali route

* Remove the "identity" block, with certificate paths, from the Kiali Config Map.

* Optionally you can also remove the annotation "service.alpha.openshift.io/serving-cert-secret-name", and the related volume that is declared and mounted in Kiali Deployment (but if you don't, they will just be ignored).

In the provided Kubernetes templates, SSL is turned on by default. If you want to turn it off, you should:

* Remove the "identity" block, with certificate paths, from the Kiali Config Map.

* Optionally you can also remove the volume that is declared and mounted in Kiali Deployment (the name of the volume and mount are both "kiali-cert". If you don't remove these, they will just be ignored.

== Exposing Kiali to External Clients Using Istio Gateway

The operator will create a Route or Ingress by default (see the Kiali CR setting "deployment.ingress_enabled"). If you want to expose Kiali via Istio itself, you can create Gateway, Virtual Service, and Destination Rule resources similiar to below:

[source,yaml]
----
---
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: Gateway
metadata:
  name: kiali-gateway
  namespace: istio-system
spec:
  selector:
    istio: ingressgateway
  servers:
  - port:
      number: 80
      name: http-kiali
      protocol: HTTP
    # https://istio.io/latest/docs/reference/config/networking/gateway/#ServerTLSSettings
    tls:
      httpsRedirect: false
    hosts: [<your-host>]
  - port:
      number: 443
      name: https-kiali
      protocol: HTTPS
    tls: {}
    hosts: [<your-host>]
...
---
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: kiali-virtualservice
  namespace: istio-system
spec:
  gateways:
  - kiali-gateway
  hosts: [<your-host>]
  http:
  - route:
    - destination:
        host: kiali.istio-system.svc.cluster.local
        port:
          number: 20001
      weight: 100
...
---
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: DestinationRule
metadata:
  name: kiali-destinationrule
  namespace: istio-system
spec:
  host: kiali
  trafficPolicy:
    tls:
      mode: DISABLE
...
